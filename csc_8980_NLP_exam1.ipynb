Do the label predictions from BERT match what your classifier from Question 4 predicted? If they don’t, are they better? Please say why. NOTE: This is a pro-level task and while you might be tempted to copy code from the Internet, do not do it, as you will fail the class if you are plagiarizing. The code from the class can be tweaked to do the task with some adjustments. This is definitely not easy, but that is why it is worth an extra 40 points!**"
